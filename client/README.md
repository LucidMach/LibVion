# Intro

This project is a `PWA` built using `create-react-app`.

## File Structure

It follows the typical `create-react-app` file structure with a small **twist**.

1. 1st-Order Components are at `./client/src/components`
2. 2nd-Order Components are at `./client/src/page`

> 2nd Order Components are Components Composed of 1st-Order Components
